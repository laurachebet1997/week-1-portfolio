        <div class="unimportant"
        <p>firstly,i didnt know coding and was trying to pursue insuarance as acareer choice.
            little did i know that most studies of data collection requires good computer skills.
            thats when i got to know programming,using R .twas a bit tricky since i knew no basics
            of the programming language.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>from then i took the guts to dive into it and found it interesting.
            my question was "if R was like that,whats stopping me from learning deeper coding?".and thats when
            i got an interest and here i am.i needed to start from scratch n my most recommended place was MORINGA SCHOOL.
